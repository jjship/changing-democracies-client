How do they learn not only about but also from these histories – on their own terms and in their own voice? And, importantly in light of the objectives of Changing Democracies, does learning about histories of dictatorship lead young people to critically reflect about democracy and peace, and, if so, how and in what ways? ",
    "p1": "In this edited volume, six partners of the consortium report on their research efforts into how young people engaged with the testimonies in local educational projects. Although guided by the same set of research questions, the six case studies cover an fascinating variety of work forms – ranging from traditional dialogues to work on online learning platforms and arts-based practices such as illustrations and theatre – and cultural contexts, from Spain and Portugal, the Czech Republic and Poland, to the Netherlands and Flanders/Belgium.",
